This project is a translator of French words that gives it in Morse language and the same thing as reverse. This has been made by Yanis Crisostomo, I'm a student in Python, I hope you will like it. In the repository,
you will also find the .exe file to execute the script. Make sure you have the winsound, tkinter and time libraries installed on your
computer for a full experience. Enjoy!
